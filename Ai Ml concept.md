#  SmartSeat: Intelligent Seat Reservation and Attendance Management System

## 1. Overview  
**SmartSeat** is a web-based system designed to help **students and teachers manage seat reservations and attendance efficiently** within a school environment.  
It provides an intuitive interface for booking seats, checking availability, and tracking attendance—all integrated in one platform.  
The system enhances classroom organization, ensures fairness in seat allocation, and automates attendance recording through smart technology.

---

## 2. System Objectives  
- Enable students to reserve seats for lectures or study sessions.  
- Allow teachers to monitor seat usage and attendance in real time.  
- Reduce double-booking or seat conflicts through intelligent allocation.  
- Provide data-driven insights on seat utilization and class participation.

## 3. Core Features  

###  Seat Reservation  
- Real-time seat availability visualization (interactive map).  
- Role-based access (student / teacher).  
- Reservation creation, modification, and cancellation.  
- Integration with class schedules for automatic seat locking.  

###  Attendance Management  
- QR-based check-in/out for each class session.  
- Optional seat-based check-in (reservation + time = attendance).  
- Real-time attendance dashboard for teachers.  
- Automated attendance reports per class or user.  

###  AI/ML Integration  
The AI/ML component supports decision-making and automation by:  
- Predicting seat demand and peak hours.  
- Recommending fair seat distribution to prevent overuse of popular seats.  
- Detecting unusual attendance patterns (e.g., frequent absences or duplicate check-ins).  
- Continuously improving accuracy through learning from booking and attendance data.

## 4. Data Schema (Simplified)  

| Table | Key Fields | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **users** | user_id, role(student/teacher), name, email | System users |
| **seats** | seat_id, room, row, column, attributes | Seat information |
| **reservations** | reservation_id, user_id, seat_id, class_id, start_time, end_time, status | Seat booking data |
| **classes** | class_id, title, teacher_id, start_time, end_time, room | Class schedule |
| **attendance** | attendance_id, user_id, class_id, reservation_id, timestamp, method | Attendance log |

---

## 5. Example API Design  

### Reservation Endpoints  
```http
GET /seats?room=101&time=2025-10-10T10:00      # Get available seats  
POST /reservations                             # Create a reservation  
DELETE /reservations/:id                       # Cancel reservation  
```

### Attendance Endpoints  
```http
POST /attendance/checkin                       # Student check-in (QR or seat-based)  
GET /attendance/class/:class_id                # Teacher view attendance  
```

---

## 6. AI/ML Baseline Concept  
In the initial phase (Sprint 1), SmartSeat uses a **rule-based scoring model** to assist with seat allocation and fairness.

### Example Baseline Logic  
```python
score = (0.5 * seat_availability) + (0.3 * distance_from_teacher) + (0.2 * fairness_factor)
```
- **seat_availability** → whether the seat is empty  
- **distance_from_teacher** → for balanced distribution  
- **fairness_factor** → to avoid repetitive use of the same seat  

The system recommends or assigns the seat with the highest score.

## 7. Development Roadmap  

| Phase | Focus Area | Features | Outcome |
|-------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| **Sprint 1 (Now)** | System Setup | Rule-based seat allocation, basic reservation and attendance design | Functional prototype |
| **Sprint 2** | Data Integration | Real reservation and attendance data storage | Dynamic dashboard & analytics |
| **Sprint 3** | AI/ML Enhancement | Prediction, fairness optimization, usage insights | Adaptive and intelligent allocation |

---

## 8. Future Improvements  
- Predictive seat recommendations using ML models.  
- Automatic attendance marking based on booking and presence data.  
- Integration with campus Wi-Fi or location-based verification.  
- Data visualization dashboard for teachers and administrators.  

---

## 9. Summary  
SmartSeat combines **seat reservation** and **attendance management** into a unified platform for educational institutions.  
Starting from rule-based logic and evolving into an AI-driven system, SmartSeat aims to enhance classroom organization, promote fairness, and automate routine management tasks for both students and teachers.
