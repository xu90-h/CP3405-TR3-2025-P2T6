# 🧠 SmartSeat – Week 5: Data Strategy

## Goal
To define the data plan for the SmartSeat system, including what kind of data is used, its source, structure, and privacy policy.  
This strategy supports the AI/ML baseline model and simulates real classroom scenarios safely using mock data.

---

## Data Source
Since the SmartSeat project is still in its prototype stage, all datasets are **mock data (fake classroom data)** created manually or generated by code.  
No real user or image data is used.  
These datasets are used to simulate seat usage, reservation history, and attendance tracking.

| Dataset | Description | Purpose |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| `seats.csv` | Contains information about seat availability, distance from teacher, and fairness factors. | Used for AI seat scoring and recommendation. |
| `reservations.csv` | Stores simulated booking history for users. | Used to analyze seat popularity and detect overuse. |
| `attendance.csv` | Tracks attendance based on reservation and time. | Used to identify attendance trends and anomalies. |

---

## Data Format (Example)

### `seats.csv`
| seat_id | available | distance_from_teacher | fairness_factor |
|----------|------------|------------------------|------------------|
| A1 | 1 | 0.8 | 0.5 |
| A2 | 0 | 0.4 | 0.3 |
| A3 | 1 | 0.6 | 0.6 |

### `reservations.csv`
| reservation_id | user_id | seat_id | class_id | start_time | end_time | status |
|----------------|----------|----------|-----------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| R001 | U01 | A1 | C101 | 2025-10-10 09:00 | 2025-10-10 10:00 | confirmed |
| R002 | U02 | A2 | C101 | 2025-10-10 09:00 | 2025-10-10 10:00 | cancelled |

### `attendance.csv`
| attendance_id | user_id | class_id | reservation_id | timestamp | method |
|----------------|----------|-----------|----------------|------------|---------|
| ATT01 | U01 | C101 | R001 | 2025-10-10 09:05 | seat-based |
| ATT02 | U02 | C101 | R002 | 2025-10-10 09:10 | qr-scan |

## Privacy Policy
- All data is **fake and anonymous**.  
- No real student names, IDs, or personal information are included.  
- No real classroom photos or sensor data are used.  
- All files are stored locally (`.csv` format) for AI/ML testing purposes only.  
- The dataset will never be used for commercial or public purposes.

---

## Usage
These mock datasets are used by the AI/ML baseline model (`ai_baseline.py`) to simulate:
- Seat scoring and recommendation (based on quietness, fairness, distance, etc.)  
- Prediction of seat demand and overuse.  
- Simple attendance trend detection.

This supports the Week 5 milestone: **"Data Strategy & ML Baseline Setup"**.

---

## Summary
The SmartSeat Data Strategy ensures:
- Safe and ethical data simulation (no personal data).  
- Clear structure for AI testing and future expansion.  
- A solid foundation for moving to **Week 6: Live Data Integration**.
